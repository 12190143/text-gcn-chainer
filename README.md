# Text GCN on Chainer

This project implements [Yao et al. 2018. Graph Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. ArXiv.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05679) in [Chainer](https://chainer.org/).
The project includes code to reproduce text classification experiment on 20 news groups dataset. **This is NOT an official implementation by the authors.**

# How to Run

## Prerequisite

I have only tested the code on Python 3.6.4. Install dependent library by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running training and evaluation

Run:

```
python train.py
```

Refer to `python train.py -h` for options.


# Reproducing the paper

(coming soon.)
